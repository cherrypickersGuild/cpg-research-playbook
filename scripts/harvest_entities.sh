#!/usr/bin/env bash
# harvest_entities.sh — repeatedly builds candidate batches for one topic,
# runs Stage 1G over them, and merges into state/entity_registry.json until
# the topic has >= target verified entities, or sources are exhausted.
#
# "Verified" means description_source:"verified" — the description was
# fetched from the entity's OWN primary page (target_url: repo, docs page,
# model card, package page, paper, or official product page), never from
# the citing page (source_url: an awesome-list row, a search-hit page, a
# news article) and never from a search snippet alone. Awesome-list README
# URLs are seed material only — they appear as a candidate's source_url,
# never as its target_url.
#
# Candidate Hit shape emitted by the candidate-batch step (and consumed by
# 1G): {hits:[{source_url, target_url, title, snippet, domain}]}.
#   - source_url: original seed URL — the awesome-list row, search-hit page,
#     or citing article that surfaced this candidate. Always present.
#   - target_url: best-effort resolved primary URL for the entity, OR the
#     literal string "unknown" if the candidate-batch step could not
#     confidently determine one. 1G may still resolve it later via WebFetch.
#
# github_stars: populated by 1G only when target_url is a confirmed GitHub
# repo root (fetched live from the GitHub API — a number, current as of that
# fetch, expected to change run over run). null for every non-GitHub entity
# and never inferred from a page that merely mentions a star count.
# See docs/entity_harvest_plan.md for the full design.
#
#   Usage: bash scripts/harvest_entities.sh <agent|mcp|prompt|skill> [target=250] [--check]
#
# `target` is the FINAL total number of verified entities the registry should
# reach for this topic — NOT a number to add. Existing verified entities count
# toward it, so the loop only needs to close the gap (target - current). The
# canonical count is: entities in state/entity_registry.json whose topic
# exactly matches AND description_source == "verified". Dedup is by entity_key
# at merge time, so duplicates/rejects/search-hits are never counted.
#
# `--check` prints one status line (current/target/remaining/status) and exits
# 0 WITHOUT any claude call or side effects — used by scripts/harvest_all.sh to
# skip already-complete topics, and by the target tests. Needs only jq.
#
# Reaching a large target (e.g. 250) is done in bounded per-loop batches
# (BATCH_SIZE candidates each), merging after every batch; an interrupted run
# resumes from the merged registry count on re-invoke.
#   BATCH_SIZE (default 40)  candidate URLs requested per loop
#   MAX_LOOPS (default 40)   hard upper bound on loops
#   NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD (default 3)  consecutive no-progress loops before stop
# Test/isolation overrides (default to production behavior):
#   STATE_DIR   relocate all state/registry/log/batch paths (default: <repo>/state)
#   CLAUDE_BIN  the claude executable to invoke (default: claude)
#
# Exit 0: target reached; OR sources exhausted (NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD
#         consecutive no-progress loops); OR MAX_LOOPS reached — each printed
#         with the final tally. A clean exit does NOT imply the target was met;
#         read the printed status (or re-run with --check) to confirm.
# Exit 1: missing dependency, bad arguments, a claude/jq step failing, or a
#         persistent file (ledger/registry) found or left invalid JSON.
#
# Timing recovery: every run writes structured JSONL timing events to
# state/logs/harvest_<run_id>.jsonl (gitignored, transient) — see
# docs/entity_harvest_workflow.md § Timing logs for the event schema and how
# to reconstruct run/topic/loop/subprocess/merge durations from it.
